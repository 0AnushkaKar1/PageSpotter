# Here's a short description of the project :

- Pagespotter is a chrome extension that acts a secondary bookmark tab
- Event listeners are used to get current tab by using Chrome API to get tab
- innerHTml property used to render out the leads or the tab links stored in the list.
- input value property used to fetch out the value that the user had entered into the input field
- template strings used because it looks much better and easier to parse.
- Things were stored in localstorage so that we could work across page refresh. 
- JSON object was used to store this data 
- Manifest.json file was used to configure our application

PageSpotter is the perfect tool for anyone who wants to keep their favorite web pages organized and easily accessible.

As of now, this is Version 1.0  so, it may not have a bunch of features.....
But soon it will be updated and anyone can download it as a Chrome extension from the Chrome Webstore.
