# Here's a short description of the project :

- PageSpotter is a Chrome extension that allows users to easily save and access their favorite web pages with just a few clicks. 
- Users can quickly bookmark the link of the current active window and store it for later use. 
- This makes it easy to come back to important pages without having to search through browsing history or bookmarks. 
- Users can simply return to PageSpotter at any time to access the links they've saved. 
- It has a simple and intuitive interface 

PageSpotter is the perfect tool for anyone who wants to keep their favorite web pages organized and easily accessible.

As of now, this is Version 1.0  so, it may not have a bunch of features.....
But soon it will be updated and anyone can download it as a Chrome extension from the Chrome Webstore.
